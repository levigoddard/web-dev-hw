      <h1><p> An excerpt from “The Merchant of Venice”</p></h1>
      <p> By Shakespeare (1605) </p>
      <h2><p>ACT I</p></h2>
      <p>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</p>
      <p>------------------------------</p>
      <p>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</p>

      <p> ANTONIO</p>

        <p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
          It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
          But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
          What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
          I am to learn;
          And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
          That I have much ado to know myself.</p>

      <p>SALARINO</p>

      <p>    Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
          There, where your argosies with portly sail,
          Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
          Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
          Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
          That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
          As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>

    <p>  SALANIO</p>

        <p>  Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
          The better part of my affections would
          Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
          Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
          Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
          And every object that might make me fear
          Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
          Would make me sad.</p>

    <p>  SALARINO</p>

      <p>    My wind cooling my broth
          Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
          What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
          I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
          But I should think of shallows and of flats,
          And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
          Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
          To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
          And see the holy edifice of stone,
          And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
          Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
          Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
          Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
          And, in a word, but even now worth this,
          And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
          To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
          That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
          But tell not me; I know, Antonio
          Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>

    <p>  ANTONIO</p>

        <p>  Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
          My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
          Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
          Upon the fortune of this present year:
          Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>

    <p>  SALARINO</p>

      <p>    Why, then you are in love.</p>
