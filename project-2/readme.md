## Read me P2 ##
1. So far I have enjoyed making websites. While I have some previous experience coding, I had no real experience dealing with advanced .html editing. The basicts for code layout was more or less the same, with the concepts around the DIV being the hardest to learn.
2. I am mainly exited to learn how to make my pages look beter and stand out.
