# My First README.md
## Levi Goddard
I currently work as an advertizing designer for MQS Barn and am looking to expand my field of expertize into a more broad field. Part of this is designing websites and E-Commerce for companies here in the valley. Since I am also getting the Media Arts minor, I found it benificial to also add more advanced classes to the ones needed to compleate my education.

In the "Q & A with the internet" secton of the lession, I learned a lot more about how the internet comunicated via bits sent between severs and how the computers keep track of them. I found it amazing to really see just how young our modern internet truly is.
